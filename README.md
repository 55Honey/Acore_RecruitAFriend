LUA script for Azerothcore with ElunaLUA to connect accounts from different players and reward them for certain criteria.

### Work in progress

## Requirements:

Compile your [Azerothcore](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk) with [Eluna Lua](https://www.azerothcore.org/catalogue-details.html?id=131435473).
The ElunaLua module itself doesn't require much setup/config. Just specify the subfolder where to put your lua_scripts in its .conf file.

If the directory was not changed, add the .lua script to your `../lua_scripts/` directory.
Adjust the top part of the .lua file with the config flags.
